In what way does the text take effectiveness of conservation into consideration? Examples of ways in which this effectiveness can be taken into consideration are good management of the area, ecological representativeness, well-connectedness, integrating areas into wider landscapes, or governing areas in an equitable way.	The text from various countries addresses the effectiveness of conservation through different strategies and measures. Here's a summary of how these countries consider conservation effectiveness, clustered based on common approaches:  ### Cluster 1: Comprehensive Approach Countries in this cluster emphasize a holistic approach to conservation, incorporating management, ecological representativeness, connectivity, integration into wider landscapes, and equitable governance. Examples include:  - **Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Gabon, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela, Zambia, Zimbabwe**: These countries focus on comprehensive strategies that include effective management, ecological representation, connectivity, integration, and governance.  ### Cluster 2: Focus on Management and Governance Countries in this cluster prioritize good management practices and equitable governance, often involving local communities in conservation efforts.
